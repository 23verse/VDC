<p>Taking as two inputs (i) the host gene list (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22810586">paper</a>) and (ii) GWAS-detected SNPs for cell proliferation disorders (sourced from the GWAS Catalogue), we first generated the list of host genes ranked by priority rating (scored 0-5; see the column <code>Rating</code>).</p>
