[["index.html", "Discovery of innovative target genes for virus-associated cancers Section 1 Abstract", " Discovery of innovative target genes for virus-associated cancers Section 1 Abstract We reason that, for cancer genes identified through virus-host interactions using in vitro models to be valid, it requires genetic support in vivo from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on neoplastic or precancerous traits. We thus revisit the list of host genes that physically interact with tumour virus, through our recently developed genetic-led target prioritisation approach. We have generated a priority list of innovative target genes, with top prioritised genes functionally relevant to transcriptional regulations by NF-kappa B in response to TNF. From the priority list, we have further identified a network of pathway crosstalk genes that can inform on a range of aspects of viral oncology: the involvement of the Notch signaling, and many tumour virus associated pathways; containing protein kinase-like structural domains, including genes targeted by drugs already in clinical use for cancers (CDK4, EGFR, and JAK1); revealing evolutionary roots in Euteleostomi identifying TFRC as under-explored relative to more studied genes (such as CDK4, FOS and STAT1/3/4) from that era; the likely involvement in telomere maintenance including TFRC in addition to known telomerase-like genes (such as MYC, FOS and STAT3); predicting upstream regulators (such as EHMT2, TFEB, CCAR2 and ERBB3) that could regulate telomerase-like genes. We conclude that the information of host-virus interactions coupled with contemporary genetic-led prioritisations can accelerate discovery of innovative targets in virus-associated cancers.
